                        Do you ever feel beat down? Worn Out? Just . . . tired?
                        God calls us to times of rest and restoration. The Holy Spirit within us has power â€“
                        the same power that raised Christ from the dead. He makes you whole again,
                        and He energizes you as you seek to obey Jesus. Often it starts with a sincere
                        time of humble prayer and resting in the love of God. You are in Christ. You are loved.
                        If God is for you, who can be against you? Does all the rest of the difficulties even compare
                        to what God has in store for you?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The message of Easter is a message of HOPE! Never despair; look up.
                        Let God lift you up. Jesus is risen! He leads you in victorious celebration.
                        Follow Him one step at a time. Be encouraged and then encourage others.
                        <br>In Christ, Pastor Ron
